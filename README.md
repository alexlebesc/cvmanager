I need to update my online CV. It has to be mobile friendly and responsive.
It would be great if I can use markdown for the content of the CV
The CV needs to be in English and in French.
I need to illustrate my experience with some snapshots of the site I worked on.

I also need to take advantage of this project to publish some code in Github.

The budget time is 32 hours.
